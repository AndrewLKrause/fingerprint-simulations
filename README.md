# fingerprint-simulations
 
This is the repository of code associated with the paper, "The Developmental Basis of Fingerprint Pattern Formation and Variation." The 'Model Details.pdf' file contains a complete description of the mathematical models used. The codes themselves are divided into three files which respectively simulate a 2D rectangular version of the model, a mouse-scale model, and a human-scale model (both using cylindrical geometries with different parameters). The codes are .zip files containing single .mph files (for size reasons) which can be opened with COMSOL Multiphysics version 6 or higher. All of the boundary conditions and different initiation sites, as well as the parameters, can be modified in the settings of each model.
